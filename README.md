# AnisotropicPulsatingActiveMatter

In this repository you can find the scripts of my masters' thesis project on the role of anisotropy in pulsating active matter. As four models have been studied, there are four C++ scripts for running the simulations and four Julia script to visualize the evolution of the simulated system.
